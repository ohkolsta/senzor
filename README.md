#Safe driving made easy
With Senzor-Tech installed in your car, you never have to worry about being to close to the car in front of you again. A lamp in your dashboards blinks when our sensor detects that you are less than three seconds behind the car in front of you. This is to inform you that you need to slow down a bit. If you wish, a sound can also be played so you are totally sure you never are driving unsafe again.

#Crash reduction
A huge problem in traffic today is that drivers don’t recognize what distance they should have to the car in front of them in order to drive safely. Collisions as a result of this makes up a big part of our country’s yearly accidents in traffic. This porblem is prominent in all parts of our population, across ages and genders.

#Based on senzor-tech
Senzor has just delivered some ground breaking new sensor technology. The sensors uses the new laser that was inventes in 2015, wich makes Senzor safe drive one of a kind. When compared to other sensors, Senzor safe drive was found to be 90% more accurate than any other sensor in the test..
